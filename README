It contains:

1) a trace generator that can generates memory accesses(word granularity) 
with customizable spatial/temporal locality, read/write ratio, memory size..

2) a intrumentor framework that allow us to collect useful information 
from the workload.

3) memory accesses are passed to a set of intrumentors one by one. 
Instrumetors are allowed to change the memory accesses.

Warn: not release-ready. bugs(e.g memory leaks) do exist.
